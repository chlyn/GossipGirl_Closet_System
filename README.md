# GossipGirl Closet System

### Problem Statement:
Assume, you and your team member are running a clothes shop. You and your team members
are the only people to manage it. To make it manageable, you sell only couple (maybe 5, 10, or
more, but at-least 4) of different types of products. Product type examples: TShirt, Shirt, Pant, Jeans. 

Your project should have the following functionalites:
1) Insert
2) Delete
3) Sort using different criteria
    - Expensive to cheapest
    - Cheapest to expensive
    - New to old
    - Old to new
4) Search

### Instructions on running program

You will be prompted to create an Admin or User account. The program does not depend on which account you decide to go into first, the program will automatically generate 4 randomized product items. 
Whenever first starting the program you must create a new account, the program does not store any login information. After creating an account you will be brought back to the "Admin or User" screen and can now log in. You will need two seperate logins for Admin and User.

### Admin Menu
     1) Add Product (This will add a product directly into the entire program, the users will see the added product)
          DISCLAIMER ** When typing in the product number it must be a integer or there will be an error **
     2) Delete Product (Type in the product title, this is not case-sensitive)
     3) View Products (Admins get more information for viewing products than user, for example the exact listing date)
     4) Exit (This takes you back to the account type selection, it does NOT end the program)

### User Menu
     1) Go Shopping! (This will take you to the shopping experience)
        - You will be displayed all product items and will be given the chance to filter based on your choice, or not filter at all
        - After filtering you can then choose to search by title or category. 
          Category has four options and is not case sensitive (Tshirt, Blouse, Skirt, Jean). You can choose to not search at all.
        - Once filtering and searching is done, you can choose to add an item to your cart. 
          If you select yes, will be prompted to add it by title, this is case-sensitive and the title must exactly match what is in the catelog.
     2) View Cart (This will take you to a different cart menu)
     3) Exit (This takes you back to the account type selection, it does NOT end the program)

### Cart Sub Menu
     All products in your cart will be displayed here, if empty it will say "Cart Empty :("
     
     1) Delete Items (This will delete item directly from your cart)
     2) Check Out (You will be prompted to type in your card information, after checking out your cart will be cleared, and the purchased items will be removed from the catelog)
     3) Go Back Shopping (You will be brought back to the main User menu)

You can switch between Admin or User as many times as you want, there are no restrictions.

Once you are done with the program, select the "Exit" option on either Admin or User. You will be brought back to the account selection page, you can then type in "#" to end the program.
